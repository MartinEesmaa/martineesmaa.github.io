Martin, thank you very much for that insightful consideration of privacy principles number 6, 12 and 13. 
Think you did very well, lovely, well detailed explanations, but at the same time, very clear and easy to understand. 

I did like that you looked at number 12, which is one that isn't, it seems obvious and simple, 
but it's never considered within the Australian Privacy Principles as much. 

People know it's there, but forget it's there. So, well done on looking at that particular principle as well. 

Thank you for your insightful view of those principles.
