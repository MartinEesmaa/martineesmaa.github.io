In the ICT workplace multiple activities are impacted by privacy principles.
One of these activities is the collection of personal data 
and how companies use it. 

It aligns with principle one, lawfulness, fairness and transparency. 
Another of these activities is the limitation of access to sensitive data
and how employally employees only have access to the information based 
on their specific roles. 

This follows principle two, purpose limitation. 

The final activity is companies keeping personal data, 
as long as it is required and getting rid of the data safely and securely. 
This aligns with principle three, data minimization, and storage limitation. 

Thank you.

Hi, Ikenna! Thank you for your audio recording.

After listening to your audio, you did a pretty good job on your task.
Now, one thing I think I forgot to mention is something missing from the anonymous
of APP number 2 privacy principle.

For number 2, it could be improved by watching research videos on YouTube and conducting anonymous research.
Overall, it is well done. Thank you for giving me details.

Best,
Martin Eesmaa
