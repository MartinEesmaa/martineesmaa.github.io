Hello! My name is Martin Eesmaa.

I will outline three key principles from the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

The first are APP 6, APP 12, and APP 13. Let's start with my research on three key points.

Number 6: Use or disclosure of personal information.
Personal information is used to store personal data on a server by collecting information such as usernames, passwords, emails, phone numbers, and other details, which are required by law in some countries.

Disclosing personal information can be done at the request of law enforcement, such as through warrants, or with the permission of third parties or the user.
Any disclosure of personal information to others without permission could result in fines and/or a jail sentence.
However, law enforcement can obtain warrants when a judge signs them, and it may be beneficial to contact the customer to receive a copy of the warrant.


Number 12: Access to personal information

Individuals have the right to access their personal information, including their name, address, and password.
All websites that display passwords do not show the actual password result, and credit card numbers are also redacted for security reasons.


Number 13: Correction of personal information

Correcting personal information can be done manually at any time by the individual account holder to update their details.
If they need assistance, they can contact our support team.

Some businesses do not allow employees, for example, to change their full name. To change your full name, you must contact support and provide a certificate of name change for security purposes.

So that is all three of my principles. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for listening to my tunes!

Kind regards,
Martin Eesmaa
